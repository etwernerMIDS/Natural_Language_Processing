# Natural Language Processing

## Erin Werner


Understanding language is fundamental to human interaction. Our brains have evolved language-specific circuitry that helps us learn it very quickly; however, this also means that we have great difficulty explaining how exactly meaning arises from sounds and symbols. Natual Language Processing (NLP) is a broad introduction to linguistic phenomena that attempts to analyze them with machine learning. 

The [projects](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/Projects) in this repository will cover different aspects within the filed of matural language processing, such as 

* Sentiment Analysis
  * Bag-of-Words Models 
  * Convolution Neual Networks (CNNs)
  * BERT Language Modeling
* Summarization
  * Named Entity Recognition   
* Machine Translation
  * Sequence-to-Sequence Models
