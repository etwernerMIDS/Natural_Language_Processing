CHANGE:::

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. This can be achieved with both supervised (labeled) and unsupervised (unlabeled) learning techniques.

The [projects](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Machine_Learning/tree/master/Projects) in this repository will cover different aspects within the filed of machine learning, such as 

* Building a Classifier & Making Predictions:
  * *Supervised* - K-NN, Naive Bayes, Linear & Logistic Regression
  * *Unsupervised* - K-Means, GMM
* Processing Text Data
  * Count Vectorization
  * TFIDF Tokenization
* Recommending Similar Products & Users
  * Collaborative Filtering
  * Latent Factorization
