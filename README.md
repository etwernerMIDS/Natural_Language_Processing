# Natural Language Processing

## Erin Werner


Understanding language is fundamental to human interaction. Our brains have evolved language-specific circuitry that helps us learn it very quickly; however, this also means that we have great difficulty explaining how exactly meaning arises from sounds and symbols. Natual Language Processing (NLP) is a broad introduction to linguistic phenomena that attempts to analyze them with machine learning. 

The [projects](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Natural_Language_Processing/tree/main/Projects) in this repository will cover different aspects within the filed of matural language processing, such as 

* Information Extraction:
  * *Supervised* - K-NN, Naive Bayes, Linear & Logistic Regression
  * *Unsupervised* - K-Means, GMM
* Machine Translation
  * Count Vectorization
  * TFIDF Tokenization
* Sentiment Analysis
  * Collaborative Filtering
  * Latent Factorization
* Summarization
