    "So, for our personal cleaning technique, we are going to make several changes to the original content. First, we are going to clean the text of special characters, remove stopwords, and lower the text. Then, we are going to replace user tags and website instances with the token 'USERTAGINSTANCE' and 'WEBSITEINSTANCE' respectively. This is because there might be an influence in sentiment related to these Twitter interactions that can be useful in our model. These replacements will allow us to generalize these actions similar to how numbers would be replaced in other NLP tasks. Last, we will split up the emoji name descriptions into individual tokens. This is because each name contains phrases that might be more influential as individual tokens compared to as a single token. Therefore, this cleaning approach will have different results compared to the original data."
