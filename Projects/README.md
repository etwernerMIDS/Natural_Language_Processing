Social media has provided the public with a platform for personal expression. This new outlet has given businesses the ability to easily assess the opinion of the consumer. By automatically detecting the overall feeling behind social media discourse, businesses can make more accurate decisions. 

The purpose of this project is to determine the nuanced feeling behind a tweet, which goes even further than just learning the binary positive or negative attitude of the user. More specifically, we want to attempt to detect the actual emotion that is expressed from the text. This is important because it will provide an even better understanding of what the user is trying to communicate. In this project, we will examine several different data cleaning methods as well as various machine learning models in order to determine what combination of techniques best classifies the emotion of a tweet.

For this project, we experimented with several different text-cleaning techniques as well as machine learning models. This directory contains all of the code used to accomplish our goal.

Text Preprocessing: 
- Original Raw Tweet Text
- Tweet-Specific Custom Cleaned Text
- General Custom Cleaned Text

Machine Learning Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Single-Layer Perceptron
- Shallow & Deep Convolutional Neual Networks
- BERT Language Modeling

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W266 - Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning. These were completed using Python Jupyter Notebooks.*
